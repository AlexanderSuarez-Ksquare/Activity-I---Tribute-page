        <h2>10 things you didn't know about Steve Jobs:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Steve Jobs was adopted. Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, to
            Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble. Schieble put Jobs up for
            adoption after deciding that she should not keep the baby. However,
            years later, they had a daughter that they kept.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jobs almost became a Buddhist monk. In 1974 Jobs traveled to India
            to stay at the Neem Karoli ashram, seeking spiritual enlightenment.
            He headed to the ashram of Haidakhan Babaji, where he spent seven
            months before returning to the US. Jobs started to practice Zen
            Buddhism, which became a huge part of his life. At one point, he
            considered becoming a monk at Eihei-Ji in Japan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Steve Jobs was a college dropout. In 1972 Jobs enrolled at Reed
            College but dropped out after one semester. He explained to his
            parents that he didn’t want to waste their money on education that
            was meaningless to him.
          </li>
          <li>
            Steve Jobs Founded Apple Inc in 1976. Alongside Steve Wozniak, Jobs
            created the first Apple computer in March 1976. Wozniak designed the
            Apple I, and together with Jobs, they decided to sell it to the
            public.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jobs named an Apple computer after his daughter Lisa Nicole. Jobs
            then named the computer he was working on the "Apple Lisa". He then
            denied publically that he named the system after his daughter and
            that LISA stood for “Local Integrated Systems Architecture. In later
            years he has admitted that the project was named after his
            daughter.”
          </li>
          <li>
            He married one of his students. Jobs first met his wife-to-be in
            1989 during a lecture he was giving at Stanford Graduate School of
            Business. Laurene Powell was sat in the front row of Jobs’ lecture,
            and he couldn’t keep his eyes off her.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jobs met his biological sister at age 27. Due to being adopted as a
            child and not knowing his biological family, it took a long time to
            find out about his sister. Jobs tracked down his sister, author Mona
            Simpson and met when he was 27 years old.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1986 Steve Jobs funded the Graphics Group, which later became
            Pixar. Initially, it was a sub-company under Disney until Jobs
            invested, and the company became its own spin-off company. Disney
            bought back the company in 2006.
          </li>
          <li>He has over 300 patents to his name.</li>
